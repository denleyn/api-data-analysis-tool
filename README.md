# API-Based Data Analysis Tool

This is a beginner Python project that demonstrates how to:
- Fetch data from a public REST API
- Process and clean the data
- Generate simple summary statistics

## Purpose
This project was built as a learning exercise to practice Python, API usage, and basic data analysis concepts.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Requests
- JSON

## How It Works
1. The script sends a request to a public API
2. The response data is parsed and processed
3. Key statistics and summaries are printed to the console

## Notes
This project focuses on clarity and learning rather than production-level optimization.
